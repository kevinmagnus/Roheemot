        Elevator Pitch
    </h1>

    <p>
Hello, my name is Yahya Roheemot Opeyemi.
I recently graduated from Holy Cross Divine College, where I served as the Muslim Spiritual Prefect and ranked as one of the overall best students. I’ve earned a certificate in Digital Arabic Calligraphy Design and I’m currently building my skills in Software Engineering.  

My top three skills are communication, leadership, and creative problem-solving. 
What sets me apart is my passion for using technology to solve real-world problems, especially those affecting youth in underserved communities.  

I bring dedication, adaptability, and a fresh perspective—qualities that will help employers streamline digital solutions and improve user experiences.  

 I’m looking for opportunities—internships, mentorship, or projects—where I can grow and contribute meaningfully in the tech space.

Thank you for considering me. I’m excited to build, learn, and lead in the world of technology. 
    </p>
